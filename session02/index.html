         <h2>About me: Biography</h2>
         <p> Dalila is a Film undergrad at Hunter College and graduated from Mount Vernon STEAM Academy in 2022. 
Since she was young she dreamed of being a film artist and strived to meet her goals head-on through college courses, independent editing work, and being mentored by a film artist in her community. Once a QU student and now on Hunter soil she continues to soar in her classes, inspire others, and show enthusiasm for every opportunity presented to her so that she may be able one day to become a director and live out her days producing films based on mental health, human society and unreachable expectations of the human condition. 
She is ready to show the world what she has learned throughout her life and to give back to the world that raised her through cinema. 
As a student, Dalila is thrilled to study at Hunter with an edge and can't wait to show everyone what she's got! And she hopes to see you there.  </p>
