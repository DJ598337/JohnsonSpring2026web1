    <h3> Early 20c, Mundaneue, Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine</h3>
    <p> The Mundaneum was created in 1910, following an initiative begun in 1895 by Belgian lawyers Paul Otlet and Henri La Fontaine, as part of their work on documentation science. Otlet first called it the Palais Mondial ("World Palace"), and it occupied the left wing of the Cinquantenaire Palace, a government building in Brussels. Otlet and La Fontaine organized an International Conference of International Associations, which was the origin of the Union of International Associations (UIA).</p>

    <h3> 1945, Memex, Vannevar Bush</h3>
    <p> A memex (a portmanteau of "memory" and "index") is a hypothetical electromechanical device for interacting with microform documents and described in Vannevar Bush's 1945 article "As We May Think". Bush envisioned the memex as a device in which individuals would compress and store all of their books, records, and communications, "mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility". The individual was supposed to use the memex as an automatic personal filing system, making the memex "an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory".</p>

<h3> 1950s, The Birth of the internet, ARPANET</h3>
    <p> The Internet started in the 1960s as a way for government researchers to share information. Computers in the '60s were large and immobile and in order to make use of information stored in any one computer, one had to either travel to the site of the computer or have magnetic computer tapes sent through the conventional postal system.

Another catalyst in the formation of the Internet was the heating up of the Cold War. The Soviet Union's launch of the Sputnik satellite spurred the U.S. Defense Department to consider ways information could still be disseminated even after a nuclear attack. This eventually led to the formation of the ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), the network that ultimately evolved into what we now know as the Internet. ARPANET was a great success but membership was limited to certain academic and research organizations who had contracts with the Defense Department. In response to this, other networks were created to provide information sharing.

January 1, 1983 is considered the official birthday of the Internet. Prior to this, the various computer networks did not have a standard way to communicate with each other. A new communications protocol was established called Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP). This allowed different kinds of computers on different networks to "talk" to each other. ARPANET and the Defense Data Network officially changed to the TCP/IP standard on January 1, 1983, hence the birth of the Internet. All networks could now be connected by a universal language.</p>

    <h3> 1960s, Project Xanadu "hypertext", Ted Nelson</h3>
    <p> Nelson's vision was for a "digital repository scheme for world-wide electronic publishing". Nelson states that the idea began in 1960, when he was a student at Harvard University. He proposed a machine-language program which would store and display documents, together with the ability to perform edits. This was different from a word processor (which had not been invented yet) in that the functionality would have included visual comparisons of different versions of the document, a concept Nelson would later call "intercomparison".

On top of this basic idea, Nelson wanted to facilitate nonsequential writing, in which the reader could choose their own path through an electronic document. He built upon this idea in a paper to the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1965, calling the new idea "zippered lists". These zippered lists would allow compound documents to be formed from pieces of other documents, a concept named transclusion. In 1967, while working for Harcourt, Brace, he named his project Xanadu, in honor of the poem "Kubla Khan" by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

Nelson's talk at the ACM predicted many of the features of today's hypertext systems, but at the time, his ideas had little impact. Though researchers were intrigued by his ideas, Nelson lacked the technical knowledge to demonstrate that the ideas could be implemented. </p>

    <h3> 1971, The first email, Ray Tomlinson</h3>
    <p> In 1971, Ray Tomlinson, an engineer at the computer company Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, sent the first ever email. It was initally an experiment to see if he could get two computers to exchange a message. It was Ray who decided to use the @ symbol to seperate the recipient's name from their location. The first ever email message was: 'QWERTYUIOP'.</p>

    <h3> 1983, Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), Vint Cerf and Robert Kahn </h3>
    <p> Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn designed the architecture of the Internet and the procedures known as the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP, that allow supercomputers and desktop PCs to share the Internet.

In 1968, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency sponsored the ARPANET project to link computers for resource sharing.

Robert Kahn envisioned the Internet as an open, accessible collection of networks operated cooperatively. Based on Kahn's Open Architecture concepts, Cerf and Kahn invented their first design they called TCP in 1974. The design allowed DARPA's Packet Radio, Packet Satellite and ARPANET networks to interconnect and interwork seamlessly. TCP/IP became the required way to use the ARPA-sponsored packet networks beginning in 1983. It allowed arbitrary collections of packet networks to evolve into the Internet, enabling applications ranging from e-mail, streaming audio and video to the World Wide Web. </p>

    <h3>1989, Invention of the World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau at the European Council for Nuclear Research CERN </h3>
    <p> Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.
        The first website at CERN – and in the world – was dedicated to the World Wide Web project itself and was hosted on Berners-Lee's NeXT computer. In 2013, CERN launched a project to restore this first ever website.

On 30 April 1993, CERN put the World Wide Web software in the public domain. Later, CERN made a release available with an open licence, a more sure way to maximise its dissemination. These actions allowed the web to flourish. </p>

    <h3>1990, Foundations of a website URL /HTTP/HTML/BROWSER, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
    <p> By October of 1990, Tim had written the three fundamental technologies that remain the foundation of today’s web (and which you may have seen appear on parts of your web browser):

HTML: HyperText Markup Language. The markup (formatting) language for the web.
URI: Uniform Resource Identifier. A kind of “address” that is unique and used to identify to each resource on the web. It is also commonly called a URL.
HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol. Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.
Tim also wrote the first web page editor/browser (“WorldWideWeb.app”) and the first web server (“httpd“). By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet, and in 1991, people outside of CERN were invited to join this new web community.

As the web began to grow, Tim realised that its true potential would only be unleashed if anyone, anywhere could use it without paying a fee or having to ask for permission. </p>

  <h3>1990,The first search engine, Alan Emtage Archie index </h3>
    <p> Archie is a tool for indexing FTP archives, allowing users to more easily identify specific files. It is considered the first Internet search engine. The original implementation was written in 1990 by Alan Emtage, then a postgraduate student at McGill University in Montreal, Canada. Archie was superseded by other, more sophisticated search engines, including Jughead and Veronica, which were search engines for the Gopher protocol. These were in turn superseded by World Wide Web search engines like AltaVista and directories like Yahoo! in 1995. Work on Archie ceased in the late 1990s. A legacy Archie server was maintained for historic purposes in Poland at "Interdisciplinary Centre for Mathematical and Computational Modelling" in the University of Warsaw until 2023. </p>

    <h3>1991, First website, Tim Berners-Lee </h3>
    <p> The beginning of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet arrived on August 6, 1991, when Berners-Lee published the first-ever website. Fittingly, the site was about the World Wide Web project, describing the Web and how to use it. Hosted at CERN on Berners-Lee’s NeXT computer, the site’s URL was http://info.cern.ch. </p>

    <h3>1992, The first photo on the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee</h3>
    <p> Sir Tim Berners-Lee, founding father of the World Wide Web, was working at CERN at the time and had taken a liking to Les Horribles Cernettes’ irreverent odes to science. According to De Genarro, Berners-Lee asked him for a few scanned photos of the band to put on “some sort of information system he had just invented, called the ‘World Wide Web.'”

On July 18, 1992, this photograph of the band — comprised, at that point, of Michele Muller, Colette Marx-Nielsen, Angela Higney, and Lynn Veronneau — became the very first image uploaded to the web </p>

    <h3>1997, The invention of Wi-Fi IEEE 802.11 WIFI standard</h3>
    <p> The original version of the standard IEEE 802.11 was released in 1997 and clarified in 1999, but is now obsolete. It specified two net bit rates of 1 or 2 megabits per second (Mbit/s), plus forward error correction code. It specified three alternative physical layer technologies: diffuse infrared operating at 1 Mbit/s; frequency-hopping spread spectrum operating at 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s; and direct-sequence spread spectrum operating at 1 Mbit/s or 2 Mbit/s. The latter two radio technologies used microwave transmission over the Industrial Scientific Medical frequency band at 2.4 GHz. Some earlier WLAN technologies used lower frequencies, such as the U.S. 900 MHz ISM band.

Legacy 802.11 with direct-sequence spread spectrum was rapidly supplanted and popularized by 802.11b.</p>
